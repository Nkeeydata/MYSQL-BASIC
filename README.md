# MYSQL-BASIC
## This project shows queries ran successfully on a company's database that deals with sales and puchase strength of their customers.
### These comprises of four queries which I will highlight below :

1. [Query 1](sql_queries1.sql) : This highlights my learning phase about running short codes to `query` the `database`. Some of the codes used in querying the database is listed here.

2. [Query 2](sql_queries.sql): Here, I ran a query to retrieve information about customers from two different tables in the database.üòÉ

3. [Query 3](sql_queries3.sql) : I highlight the use of sql language to retrieve information from three tables within a database.‚ùì
